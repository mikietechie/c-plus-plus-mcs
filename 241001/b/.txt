"No dwarfs, but some kind of punishment!" thought Snow White, once again trying
to put the dwarves to sleep. If you put one down, the other one is already awake! And so on all
night.
Snow White has dwarfs, and they are all very different. She knows that it takes a few minutes to
put the ith dwarf to bed, and after that he will sleep for exactly b minutes.
Help Snow White find out if she can get at least a moment of rest when
All the dwarves will sleep, and if so, in what order should
the dwarves be put to sleep?
For example, let's say there are only two dwarfs, a1 = 1, b1 = 10, a2 = 10, b2 = 20. If
Snow White will first start laying the first dwarf, then she will need as many
10 minutes to put the second one to bed, and during that time the first one will wake up. If she
starts with the second dwarf, then she will have time to put the first one down - and get as much as 10 minutes
of rest while both are asleep.
Input data format
The first row of the input data contains the number n |1 n < 105|. The second line
contains the numbers a1,a2,,an, the third contains the numbers b1, b2,...,bn |1 a1,b, < 10Â°.
Output data format
Print out the numbers and the order in which you need to put the dwarves to
sleep in order to get at least a minute of rest. If there are several possible answers, print any
of them. If Snow White can't rest, print the number
-1.
